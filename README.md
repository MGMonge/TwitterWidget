# Basic Twitter Widget
This is a mini project I had to do for a job application and it helps to demonstrate my Vanilla PHP knowledge

### This codebase contains
- Mini version of routing
- Mini version of Container (Dependency injection)
- Basic MVC
- Basic Twitter Api consumer
- Latest tweets widget with jQuery
- Latest tweets widget with Vue JS

### Specifications of the project
Please put together a small web app using PHP that uses the Twitter API to get a list
of the usersâ€™ latest tweets and compiles them in to a little widget for a website.
**Please ensure all code is your own** and that the code can be run to check your
example works. You can use any means to do this task, as long as the code is all
your own. You can choose a framework like symfony where you build your own
bundles, or you write your own individual classes or procedural code to achieve the
aim.
Once your back-end portion is complete, please use JavaScript (either plain
JavaScript or with the jQuery library) to auto refresh or update new tweets.
Regardless of the interval you choose, inform the user every time the system is
checking for new tweets. Additionally, show us your JavaScript skills by providing
some interactivity with the displayed tweets.
